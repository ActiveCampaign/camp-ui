## Contributing

Before submitting a contribution to our library, ensure you have gone through the following steps. This will ensure each item being reviewed has already been pre-reviewed by yourself and limits the time needed to modify the component. Whether your idea or concept is large or small it all starts with a self-review. Review the following contribution types and follow their appropriate steps below.

### Small Tweaks and Fixes

Small tweaks and fixes are common. While we would like to streamline this process so anyone can fix things within our library we suggest doing the following first:

- File a new issue labelled `fix`
- Be sure to include a description of the issue or even better, screenshots

### Updating / Improving Existing Patterns

Found a way to improve an existing pattern or piece of our design kit? We love the suggestions! Updates are important parts of the design kit so that we can continue to build upon what we have. However, they could potentially be the hardest due to how many other designers are currently using the kit. Consider the following:

- Does your update or improvement change the pattern that may affect others who use it?
- Can this improvement be a _part or _addon to the existing pattern?
- File a new issue labelled `improvement`
- Be sure to include a description of your suggestion and a single .sketch file of the improved pattern(s)
- Include how this change may affect engineering changes to the existing pattern

### New Patterns

New patterns and concepts are welcomed to our design kit. However they require the most care. Be sure to follow the guidelines below.

- Does the design follow our general accessibility approach?
- Does the design consider all states of interaction? (If interactive)
- Does the design have a spec sheet to describe how it should function to an engineer?
- Does the design follow our global color theory?
- Does the design use or affect any other patterns? If so, how
- File a new issue labelled `new concept`
- Include a description and all files associated with your concept
